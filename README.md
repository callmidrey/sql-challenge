# sql-challenge
This Challenge was very interesting to me and fortunaletely did not take much time as expected. 
It was a chellenge in SQL which I kind of like and very comfortable with.

This Challenge consisted of 3 main parts:
- The Data Modeling part
It started with importing the data and creating a schemata in  http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ which produced the image as iinserted below:

- The Data Engineering part:
It can be noted that the primary keys and the composite keys were created as well as the relationships cleary created.
A schema was created for each of the six tables in the data file of this challenge.
Each oth thecsv file was imported to the corresponding SQL table.

-The Data Analysis part:
This was the last part of the project that made maeaning to everything that was done earlier.
The whole parts came togther like a puzzle and the analysis wwas executed to give meaning to the requests that was made in this challenge.
